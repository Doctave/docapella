# Installation

Docapella can currently only be installed via Cargo. We will be adding more installation methods in the future.

## Installing via Cargo

First, install Rust. You can find instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Next, install Docapella:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Doctave/docapella.git docapella
```

This will install the `docapella` binary to your Cargo bin directory.

You can now run `docapella --help` to see the available commands.
