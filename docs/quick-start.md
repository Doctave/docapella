# Quick start

Once you have [installed](installation.md) Docapella, you can create a new project with the `docapella init` command.

## Creating a new project

First, create a folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Then, run the `init` command:

```bash
docapella init
```

This will bootstrap a new project in the **current directory**.

## Running the development server

To preview your documentation, run the `dev` command:

```bash
docapella dev
```

This will start a local server and open your documentation in your browser.

Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to preview your documentation.
