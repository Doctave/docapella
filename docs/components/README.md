# Docapella Components

Docapella comes with a list of components that you can use in your documentation project.

They use an MDX-inspired syntax, but critically, are not MDX.

```html title="Component example Â· Card
<Callout type="info">
  This is a callout
</Callout>
```

## Built-in components

Docapella comes with a library of **UI and layout components**. The former are "widgets" that you can use to build your documentation, such as [multi-language code examples](./code-select.md) or [callouts](./callout.md). The latter are components you can use to build more complex layouts, such a [flex](./flex.md) and [grid](./grid.md) components.

## Custom components

You can also create your own components. These are useful when you want to reuse a component across multiple documentation projects.
